Lots of mess.\nSo I thought I should face my fears by showing one of these mistakes (or rather \"design through process\" ) on this hollow P bass I'm currently working on.\n\nI like deep arm cuts on all my instruments, so I gave this guy the same treatment, but oh snap, I accidentally carved into the position where the bridge is going.\n\nSo one of my apprentices spent today carving a piece of bubinga (to match the fretboard) to act as a spacer between the curved body and the bridge. We will come up with a nice shape for it tomorrow to turn it into a design feature. It'll probably end up being the thing that I like the most about this build.

The argument is that there is less material in the nut to dampen the string vibration, and that the nut vibrates more readily (as it takes less enegery to make it vibrate)\n\nI've been meaning to try it for years, but not had the time, or a good test guitar to try it.\n\nThis naked morty batch was a perfect platform for experimenting as I have so many identical/similar builds on at the moment. So I could easily compare a scalloped to a non scalloped nut on guitars with otherwise identical woods, body shapes and neck carves. \n\nSo I tried one out and was amazed at the difference. Noticeably more volume coming from the headstock area with the scalloped nut, and a more lively feeling neck (in terms of vibration)\n\nSo I'm gonna do my nuts like this from now on.\n\nPlus it looks really cool.","image":"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/116683711_300390631196768_3233102189522784885_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=c6j9E_UZr1sAX-DdazG&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=27d27e7d6ad3c7a4813e68dbca357baa&oe=5F505AF2","type":"CAROUSEL_ALBUM","Field 6":"2020-08-04T20:34:06.000Z"},"createdTime":"2020-08-04T20:34:06.000Z"},{"id":"reczaCS9pBpc9FhcS","fields":{"permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CDe99wnJkQQ/","caption":"The ever lovely Al and Kasper from @culturedguitarist decided I deserved moar time to talk about my guitars, so invited me back for a second part to last weeks podcast.\n\nThis one gets much more geeky then the last.
