## We're planning a Canadian adventure
We are planning a trip to Vancouver and will be exploring the area to discover the widlife of British Columbia and the Yukon, including:

* Spirit and grizzly bears in the Great Bear Rainforest
* Getting up close with whales from a kayak on the Campbell river
* Watching the Northern lights from the Alaska highway

If you'd like to give us a gift, we'd really appreciate a contribution towards our trip.
