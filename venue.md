## Parking
There is plenty of free parking in Milnthorpe Road and along the seafront. 

The only parking available in the chapel grounds is for bridal cars as we must keep one bay spare for emergency services and the registrars.


## The Balcony
The Balcony is NOT for guests, children are not permitted to use the staircase or the balcony under any circumstances. The Staircase has a safety gate with a chain that locks, it is your responsibility to ensure that the gate is locked after use. This area is not supervised by staff.
